## Interface

Audiences can use their phone to select parameters for each scene via a web interface. Up to three people can choose at once and if there are more people present and connected then they get held in a queue until it’s their turn. Whilst [the scene](#content-a-scene) is unfolding, connected audience members can provide feedback to the characters by throwing items on stage - flowers and coins if they feel positively, eggs and tomatoes if not.

The interface also provides an overview of the installation and interaction, meaning that this does not have to happen within the simulation itself. The link between the two is <SidebarLink content={<SectionTheDirector/>}>the director</SidebarLink> who breaks the fourth wall to encourage interaction during the scene.

## Server

The interface is built as a single page web app and connects to a Node.js server which passes information between the interface and the simulation via websockets. The server also keeps track of all players connected in a queue, informing players how long they have until it’s their turn.
