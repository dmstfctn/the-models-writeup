*The Models* (2025) is an interactive installation by artist duo [dmstfctn](https://dmstfctn.net) exploring the improvisational nature of generative AI, and its sometimes unexpected and nonsensical character.

Inspired by the Italian theatrical tradition of Commedia dell’Arte, the installation consists of a year’s worth of improvised theatrical scenes generated with a system of text and voice AI models inside a [3D simulation](#content-the-output-systen) running on a video game engine. Each scene features a cast inspired by traditionally [friendly, servile, lying, or antagonistic](#content-ai-tendencies) Commedia masks — Arlecchino, Balanzone, Brighella, Colombina, Pantalone and Pulcinella.

Surfacing the ways in which Large Language Models can exhibit similar behaviours, a system of four generative AI models - designed by the artists and run on the [Leonardo Supercomputer](#content-hardware-and-batching) - generates dialogues for the masks, surfacing the ways in which Large Language Models can exhibit similar behaviours. Each scene includes two masks, a controversial theatrical prop suggestive of superstition, folklore, or popular falsehoods, and a painted backdrop recovered from a XX century Italian puppet theatre collection.

Audience members select the masks and prop for each scene [using their phones](#content-interface-and-server), effectively prompting the AI system and triggering the 3D simulation to generate a unique performance. The models’ output (the masks’ dialogues) is at once improvised and informed by a ‘knowledge’ of Commedia archetypes rooted in literature and popular media - emerging through statistical resonance with patterns in the models’ training data. Shared by models and audiences alike, this knowledge provides a foundation for improvisation, confabulation, mistakes, jokes and surprise.
