## Not a bug but a feature

At each stage of the AI generation system there is potential for error or mistakes to emerge in the generation of text or audio, or in the transcription of the audio. These are intentionally left in to allow some of the character of generative AI to come in, alongside the tendencies the project highlights, as well as a source of comedy (of an absurd, machinic, kind).

The transcription introduces errors, particularly of names. For example:

Pulcinella = Mr Punch
Pulcinella = Paul Cinella
Colombina = Colin Beaver
