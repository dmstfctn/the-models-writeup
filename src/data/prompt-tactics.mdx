## Prompt Tactics

Through the iterative process of working on the final modular prompt, we tested three tactics to influence text generation in distinct ways. These are not intended as rigid formulas but rather approaches to be further tested, adapted, and layered to achieve the desired generative behaviour.

1. The most tested approach is roleplaying, where framing the AI as a specific persona leads to more consistent outputs. Providing clear examples ensures precision, while invoking a well-known author with defining adjectives nudges the model toward stylistic alignment.
2. The structure of the prompt can be designed to direct focus on key words or concepts, which can influence the model’s word choice. For instance, placing the description of the globe, one of the controversial props, towards the end of a scene may result in adjectives such as “spherical”, “otherworldly”, “all-around-great” being used by the models when describing the setting.
3. Conditional as well as temporal constraints can sometimes induce hallucination and infinite looping, revealing pressure points in the model’s logic.
