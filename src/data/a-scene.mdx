*The Models* takes place in a virtual theatre, in which characters on a small stage act out these tendencies through generated scenes. Each character is associated with a different tendency and in each scene a pair of characters are placed in a particular setting, with an object or prop. Each element is essentially a proxy for a block of text that will be passed to a modular LLM prompt to generate the scene’s underlying script - the setting and prop inform characters’ dialogue, and they respond in line with their defined role.

        Balanzone confabulates and uses malapropisms, doesn't get it right but says it very convincingly. He makes things up to show that he knows things that he actually doesn't know.

### Props

There are 14 props. Some refer to common misconceptions or controversial topics

Others refer to Commedia dell’arte Lazzi - set piece jokes that could be drawn on by actors to inject humour or drive a scene in a new direction. Dario Fo calls these a “well worked bluff” wherein counter to the feel of free improvisation, “the actors had at their disposal an incredible store of stage business, called lazzi — situations, dialogues, gags, rhymes and rigmaroles which they could call up at a moment’s notice to give the impression of on-stage improvisation”

### Backdrops

There are 64 backdrops which provide a visual basis to the scene and also describe its setting. For example:
